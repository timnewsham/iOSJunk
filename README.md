# iOS Junk

This repository holds random scripts for dealing with iOS.

* [getAttachments.py](getAttachments.py) will extract attachment files from iOS backups made with iTunes.
* [getMessages.sh](getMessages.sh) will extract text messages (just the text) from iOS backups made with iTunes.


Note: to extract data from backups, your backups must be readable
(ie. on OSX http://osxdaily.com/2018/10/09/fix-operation-not-permitted-terminal-error-macos/).
